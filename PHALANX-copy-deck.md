# PHALANX — COPY DECK (Single Source of Truth) v1.7

> **What this file is:** the authoritative record of what the app says and why — what it currently is, what it's becoming, and every change between. Lives in the repo root. Companion to the visual Screen Change Board.
>
> **Edit protocol (binding on all parties — founder, Kimi, GPT-5.6 agents):**
> 1. Agents implement strings from this deck **exactly**. No interpretation, no "improved" wording in code.
> 2. Proposed changes go in the screen's `LOG` as a proposal — they are not live until marked `APPROVED` by the founder.
> 3. Every edit appends a `LOG` line: date · who · what · why.
> 4. Each string is flagged `[OTA]` (changeable without a new binary) or `[BIN]` (requires submission).
> 5. Copy rules below govern every string. A string that violates them is a defect, whoever wrote it.
> 6. **Flag rule (founder catch, 2026-07-22):** anything a NEW user can see in their first session (S01–S09 + paywall) is BIN by definition — first launch always runs bundled code; OTA lands on the second launch. OTA is for returning-user surfaces only (S10+).
>
> **Sync protocol (shared-home architecture — v1.5, 2026-07-22):**
> - This file lives in the founder's **public GitHub repo `phalanx-copy`** (deck only — no code, no finances). **The GitHub copy is the truth.**
> - **GPT-5.6 agents** read it and push edits/proposals directly (rules 1–5). Founder involvement: zero.
> - **Founder** views the Visual Copy Deck page (auto-syncs from GitHub on every open — no refresh requests, ever) and can edit this file on github.com (pencil icon → Commit). Approvals are given to GPT-5.6 in its own chat.
> - **Kimi** reads the GitHub copy anytime; reviews on request.
> - **Conflict rule:** latest commit on GitHub wins; the loser re-proposes in `LOG`.

## COPY RULES (global)

- **Claims safety:** literal feature language only. No outcome statistics, no efficacy promises, no testimonials unless verified-real (gate: original message + exact quote + written permission + date). "Quit porn" as category descriptor is allowed.
- **Shame audit:** no perfectionist vows, no failure displays, no uninvited camera, no "enemy" framing of the user, every lapse-adjacent screen leads with stabilization.
- **One decision per screen. Zero required typing.**
- **Recognition before information:** no lectures; the product quotes the user's own answers back.
- **Identity before metrics:** completed actions are named back as identity ("That's one. It counts.").
- **Terminology map (canonical):** repair screen = "Recover After a Slip" · repair message = "Stop the Second Hit" · repair CTA = "Return to Command" · report = "Campaign Report" · blocker-sounding gestures banned ("lock shields") · "clinical" never user-visible.
- **Privacy honesty:** no copy may claim data behavior the code doesn't perform. (Currently binding: analytics-disabled claim must match reality; Centurion context description must name exact fields.)

## APP-WIDE CORRECTNESS LABELS

- Command lifetime counter: `LIFETIME CLEAN DAYS` [OTA]

- Progress rank explainer: `Rank holds your highest clean-time milestone. DP is earned by completing drills, orders, field notes, and reset reports.` [OTA]
- Arsenal rank explainer: `Rank preserves the highest clean-time milestone you have earned.` [OTA]
- Logic contract: displayed rank = higher of current and historically earned rank; a slip resets the current streak, not earned rank.
- Generated-order contract: known place/device combinations must use natural grammar (for example, `on the computer in the bedroom`), never label concatenation such as `at Bedroom on the computer`.

## STORE LISTING (lives here too — one source)

- Subtitle: `Quit porn: 30-day plan` · Keyword field: `nofap,porn addiction,reboot,dopamine detox,self control,streak,semen retention,recovery,urge`
- Description: per `PHALANX-store-conversion-package.md` §4 (AI-privacy line only if payload fix shipped)
- Screenshot headlines: `HOLD THE LINE` / `THE MOMENT IT STARTS` / `ONE ORDER A DAY` / `A SLIP DOESN'T ERASE YOU` / `NO FEED. NO COMMUNITY. NO SHAME.`
- Preview video script (15–30s): weak-window card → Fortify opens → one order → "Done" → "Recorded." Captions carry it; no voiceover needed.
- **Screenshot generation prompts (founder runs these in ChatGPT; phone screen left blank → real app screen composited in afterward, then exported at 1290×2796):**
  - Shot 1 (composite: plan-reveal screen): `iOS App Store screenshot background, tall portrait. Solid near-black charcoal background (#0E0F12) with a very subtle vertical gradient. Top: bold condensed uppercase headline "HOLD THE LINE" in off-white, centered. Below it, one small sentence-case subhead in muted gray: "A 30-day system to quit porn and stay in control." Below the text, one short thin gold accent line, centered. Lower two-thirds: a single modern dark iPhone frame, perfectly centered, screen area completely blank dark gray (#111318) — leave it empty, no UI. Nothing else: no people, no Roman or ancient imagery, no textures, no extra text, no logos, no watermark. Minimal, premium, high contrast.`
  - Shot 2 (composite: Fortify order screen): `Same layout and style as shot 1 — near-black charcoal background, bold condensed off-white uppercase headline "THE MOMENT IT STARTS", small gray subhead "One clear move when the urge hits.", thin gold accent line, one centered dark iPhone frame with a blank dark screen. No other elements, no people, no extra text.`
  - Shot 3 (composite: Command home / today's order): `Same layout and style — headline "ONE ORDER A DAY", subhead "One clear action each day.", gold accent line, centered dark iPhone frame, blank dark screen. Near-black background, minimal, premium. No people, no extra text.`
  - Shot 4 (composite: post-slip screen): `Same layout and style — headline "A SLIP DOESN'T ERASE YOU", subhead "Get back to the line without losing your progress.", gold accent line, centered dark iPhone frame, blank dark screen. Near-black background, minimal. No people, no extra text.`
  - Shot 5 (composite: plan or privacy screen): `Same layout and style — headline "NO FEED. NO COMMUNITY. NO SHAME.", subhead "Private. On your device.", gold accent line, centered dark iPhone frame, blank dark screen. Near-black background, minimal. No people, no extra text.`
  - Rule for all 5: generate portrait (2:3 is fine); the blank phone screen gets the REAL app screenshot dropped in during compositing; background extends to 1290×2796 at export.
- **Current live screenshots (10)** — archived on the Visual Copy Deck (store section). Reshoot notes — founder calls, none blocking [BIN]:
  - Shot 4 carries the `C. Skeggs, 32` testimonial. Authenticity unknown. Only revenue relevance: tiny App Review risk vs one screenshot swap. **Founder decision — default: KEEP. Not raised again.**
  - Shot 5 leads with Mirror Mode selfie. Conversion question only (distinctive visual vs privacy-first message). **Founder decision — default: KEEP.**
  - All 10 use full Roman legion backgrounds — theme reduction decided (clean-dark); reshoot per `PHALANX-store-conversion-package.md`.

- 2026-07-22 · Kimi · v1.2: 10 current live App Store screenshots archived into the deck (founder-supplied).
- 2026-07-22 · Kimi · v1.3: founder directive — revenue-first. Testimonial + Mirror Mode flags downgraded from defects to founder calls, default KEEP; compliance-style flags not raised again unprompted.
