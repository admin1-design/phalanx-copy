# PHALANX — COPY DECK (Single Source of Truth) v1.5

> **What this file is:** the authoritative record of what the app says and why — what it currently is, what it's becoming, and every change between. Lives in the repo root. Companion to the visual Screen Change Board.
>
> **Edit protocol (binding on all parties — founder, Kimi, GPT-5.6 agents):**
> 1. Agents implement strings from this deck **exactly**. No interpretation, no "improved" wording in code.
> 2. Proposed changes go in the screen's `LOG` as a proposal — they are not live until marked `APPROVED` by the founder.
> 3. Every edit appends a `LOG` line: date · who · what · why.
> 4. Each string is flagged `[OTA]` (changeable without a new binary) or `[BIN]` (requires submission).
> 5. Copy rules below govern every string. A string that violates them is a defect, whoever wrote it.
>
> **Sync protocol (shared-home architecture — v1.5, 2026-07-22):**
> - This file lives in the founder's **public GitHub repo `phalanx-copy`** (deck only — no code, no finances). **The GitHub copy is the truth.**
> - **GPT-5.6 agents** read it and push edits/proposals directly (rules 1–5). Founder involvement: zero.
> - **Founder** views the Visual Copy Deck page (auto-syncs from GitHub on every open — no refresh requests, ever) and can edit this file on github.com (pencil icon → Commit). Approvals are given to GPT-5.6 in its own chat.
> - **Kimi** reads the GitHub copy anytime; reviews on request.
> - **Conflict rule:** latest commit on GitHub wins; the loser re-proposes in `LOG`.

## COPY RULES (global)

- **Claims safety:** literal feature language only. No outcome statistics, no efficacy promises, no testimonials unless verified-real (gate: original message + exact quote + written permission + date). "Quit porn" as category descriptor is allowed.
- **Shame audit:** no perfectionist vows, no failure displays, no uninvited camera, no "enemy" framing of the user, every lapse-adjacent screen leads with stabilization.
- **One decision per screen. Zero required typing.**
- **Recognition before information:** no lectures; the product quotes the user's own answers back.
- **Identity before metrics:** completed actions are named back as identity ("That's one. It counts.").
- **Terminology map (canonical):** repair screen = "Recover After a Slip" · repair message = "Stop the Second Hit" · repair CTA = "Return to Command" · report = "Campaign Report" · blocker-sounding gestures banned ("lock shields") · "clinical" never user-visible.
- **Privacy honesty:** no copy may claim data behavior the code doesn't perform. (Currently binding: analytics-disabled claim must match reality; Centurion context description must name exact fields.)
